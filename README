Twilio Email Memo App
=====================
This project uses the Twilio Developer API to implement a speech-to-text memo service.

Simply call your Twilio phone number and leave a message after the beep.  Twilio will transcribe your 
message and email the text to an address you've specified - this could be your own personal email, or
your personal Evernote email address.  Use the latter to allow you to take notes from wherever you are,
and has the advantage of working with your phone's hands-free kit.  

This app is intended to be hosted on the Google Engine API.  

To run this app:
1) Create your Twilio (http://www.twilio.com/docs) and Google Engine developer accounts
2) Pick a unique Google Engine app name, and update the WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml
3) Setup a Twilio app with a voice request URL of the form:
https://<your-app-name>.appspot.com/index.xml
4) Set your target email address in SendEmailServlet.java
5) Upload to Google Engine using:
appcfg.sh update <war directory>
6) Call your Twilio number and leave a message after the beep.  The email should be generated soon afterwards
